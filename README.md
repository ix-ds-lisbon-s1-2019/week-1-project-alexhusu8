# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live, poker game executes but a few things missing like printing winner's name and staying consistent with naming of Aces, Kings etc.

What's missing is a description of how your poker_game file works! Can't find it in the README or on the blog.
